summary: "From procrastination to progress."

Ever since I got my first iPhone in 2012 as a gift from my parents, I've always been fascinated with all the technology and the effort put into Apple products and how they continue to innovate and push the boundaries of technology with each new product and software release. The cutting-edge technology, the meticulous design, and the best material quality for their products - everything that everyone is already tired of knowing.

So, when I started programming in early 2020, I knew I had to learn how to develop iOS applications. I was fascinated by the idea of writing and creating beautiful and smooth UIs within a handcrafted and delimited environment. However, things were more challenging than you might think. The first barrier is that the iOS field in Brazil is not so developed for interns/junior programmers; breaking into this area would be very difficult; the other and most important one is that I didn't own a MacBook.

Time passed, and 3 years later - specifically in April 2023 - I got my first and one of my most desired items for my setup: a MacBook Pro. I was also already able to break into the development area, and getting a job was not a problem anymore; I had been working as a front-end engineer for almost 3 years. 

After overcoming the initial barriers, I wasn't succeeding in getting past a mental one: I've been procrastinating about learning Swift and iOS development-related stuff; I kept endlessly looking for the right resources and the perfect learning path to follow, listing and organizing the best courses out there. I found myself caught in a rabbit hole of planning.

For 2024, I want to do things differently. So here I am, attempting to build in public and documenting what I will learn.

The initial resources I will rely on are:

- [Swift's official documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/)
    
- [Hacking with Swift - 100 days of Swift from Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)
    
- [Stanford CS193p (2023 version)](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/2023)

I am not yet sure about the exact format I will follow for writing my posts; it may be a mix of brain dumps, notes, and thoughts.

Let's see!
