In the [last article](/blog/understanding-swift-core-concepts), I explored how Swift has some interesting similarities with JavaScript, especially when it comes to immutability, type safety, and operator behavior. Even though Swift has its own unique features and stricter type rules, a lot of the core concepts felt pretty familiar.

In this post, we’re going to explore Swift’s core collection types: Arrays, Dictionaries, Sets, and Enumerations. I’ll compare these with their JavaScript counterparts to see where they overlap and where they differ.

## Arrays: Swift’s Flexible Ordered Collection

If you’ve been working with JavaScript, you’re familiar with arrays. Swift’s arrays serve a similar purpose: they’re ordered collections that allow you to store and access elements by index.

**Declaration and Initialization**

In Swift, arrays are strongly typed. You declare an array using square brackets, specifying the type of elements it holds. You can initialize an array in several ways:

```swift
// Standard initialization with literal values
let shoppingList: [String] = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread"]

// Empty array 
let emptyList: [String] = []

// Using the Array() initializer
let anotherList = Array<String>(["Apples", "Oranges"])
```

This is similar to:

```javascript
// Standard initialization with literal values
const shoppingList = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread"];

// Empty array
const emptyList = [];

// Using Array constructor
const anotherList = Array("Apples", "Oranges");
```

One big difference: Swift arrays require that all elements be of the same type. JavaScript arrays can mix types freely, though this flexibility can lead to bugs.

**Common methods**

Swift arrays come with a range of useful methods. Some are very similar to JavaScript’s array methods, making the transition straightforward.

**Append**: Adds an element to the end of the array.
  
  ```swift
  shoppingList.append("Butter") // ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Butter"]
  ```

  Equivalent in JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  shoppingList.push("Butter"); // ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Butter"]
  ```

**Remove**: Removes an element at a specific index.
  
  ```swift
  shoppingList.remove(at: 1) // Removes "Eggs"
  ```

  In JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  shoppingList.splice(1, 1);  // Removes "Eggs"
  ```

**Contains**: Checks if the array contains a specific value.
  
  ```swift
  shoppingList.contains("Milk")  // true
  ```

  JavaScript's version:

  ```javascript
  shoppingList.includes("Milk");  // true
  ```

**Iterating over**

In Swift, iterating over arrays is simple, and it’s very similar to JavaScript’s `for...of` loop:

```swift
for item in shoppingList {
    print(item)
}
```

This is like:

```javascript
for (const item of shoppingList) {
    console.log(item);
}
```

Swift also supports higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, just like JavaScript.

## Dictionaries: Key-Value Storage with Strong Typing

Dictionaries in Swift are similar to objects in JavaScript, but they’re more strictly typed. A dictionary in Swift maps keys to values, where both the keys and values are type-safe.

**Declaration and Initialization**

Here’s how you define a dictionary in Swift:

```swift
let airportCodes: [String: String] = ["BER": "Berlin Brandenburg", "GRU": "Guarulhos"]
```

The closest equivalent in JavaScript would be an object:

```javascript
const airportCodes = {
    BER: "Berlin Brandenburg",
    GRU: "Guarulhos"
};
```

**Common methods**

Swift dictionaries come with a set of useful methods:

**Accessing Values**: You can access a value using its key:

  ```swift
  let city = airportCodes["BER"]  // Optional("Berlin Brandenburg")
  ```

  In JavaScript, you’d simply access the property:

  ```javascript
  const city = airportCodes["BER"];  // "Berlin Brandenburg"
  ```

  Swift returns an optional value for dictionary lookups, which requires handling missing keys explicitly. JavaScript simply returns undefined for non-existent keys.


**Updating Values**: To update or add a key-value pair, you can use the subscript syntax:

  ```swift
  airportCodes["JFK"] = "New York"

  // Or
  airportCodes.updateValue("New York", forKey: "JFK")
  ```

  Equivalent in JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  airportCodes["JFK"] = "New York";
  ```

**Removing Values**: To remove a key-value pair:

  ```swift
  airportCodes.removeValue(forKey: "LAX")
  ```

  In JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  delete airportCodes["LAX"];
  ```

**Iterating over**

In Swift, you can iterate over both the keys and values of a dictionary using `for`:

```swift
for (code, city) in airportCodes {
    print("\(code): \(city)")
}
```

This is similar to iterating over object properties in JavaScript:

```javascript
for (const [code, city] of Object.entries(airportCodes)) {
    console.log(`${code}: ${city}`);
}
```

While JavaScript requires this additional method (`Object.entries`) for the iteration, Swift offers a built-in solution.

## Sets: Unique Collections for Fast Membership Checking

Swift sets are like JavaScript’s `Set` objects. They store unique values and provide fast lookups.

**Declaration and Initialization**

To create a set in Swift:

```swift
let ingredients: Set<String> = ["Sugar", "Salt", "Flour"]
```

Similarly in JavaScript:

```javascript
const ingredients = new Set(["Sugar", "Salt", "Flour"]);
```

One key difference is that Swift’s set operations (`union`, `intersection`, etc.) are built-in, whereas JavaScript requires a bit more manual work.

**Union**: Combines two sets, keeping all unique values from both sets.

```swift
let moreIngredients: Set<String> = ["Butter", "Salt"]
let allIngredients = ingredients.union(moreIngredients) // ["Sugar", "Salt", "Flour", "Butter"]
```

In JavaScript, you would use the `Set` constructor and spread syntax to achieve the same:

```javascript
const moreIngredients = new Set(["Butter", "Salt"]);
const allIngredients = new Set([...ingredients, ...moreIngredients]); // ["Sugar", "Salt", "Flour", "Butter"]
```

**Intersection**: Finds the common values between two sets.

```swift
let commonIngredients = ingredients.intersection(moreIngredients) // ["Salt"]
```

In JavaScript, this requires filtering:

```javascript
const commonIngredients = new Set([...ingredients].filter(item => moreIngredients.has(item))); // {"Salt"}
```

## Enums: Defining a Set of Related Values

Swift’s enums are far more powerful than JavaScript’s, especially since JavaScript doesn’t have built-in support for enums (though you can mimic them with objects or TypeScript enums).

**Declaration and Raw Values**

You can define an enum in Swift with associated raw values or without them:

```swift
enum Direction {
    case north, south, east, west
}
```

If you want raw values:

```swift
enum CompassPoint: String {
    case north = "N"
    case south = "S"
    case east = "E"
    case west = "W"
}
```

In TypeScript, you would do:

```typescript
enum CompassPoint {
    North = "N",
    South = "S",
    East = "E",
    West = "W"
}
```

**Reassigning Enum Values**

You can easily reassign a variable to another enum case:

```swift
var currentDirection = Direction.north
currentDirection = .east
```

**Switch Statements**

Swift’s `switch` statements are powerful when working with enums. They require handling all cases unless you use a `default` case:

```swift
switch currentDirection {
case .north:
    print("Heading north")
case .south:
    print("Heading south")
case .east:
    print("Heading east")
case .west:
    print("Heading west")
}
```

**Iterating Over Cases**

Swift allows you to iterate over all cases of an enum if it conforms to the `CaseIterable` protocol:

```swift
enum Beverage: CaseIterable {
    case coffee, tea, juice
}

for drink in Beverage.allCases {
    print(drink)
}
```

These features are not directly available in JavaScript, though you can simulate it with arrays or objects.

---

In summary, Swift’s Arrays and Dictionaries are pretty similar to JavaScript’s, but with the perk of stricter type safety. Swift Sets bring some cool advantages like fast membership checks and built-in operations that JavaScript makes you work for. Plus, Swift Enums are a step up from what you get in JavaScript, offering a handy way to handle fixed sets of values with more control.

In the upcoming post, I’ll dive into Swift’s optionals, nil coalescing, and optional chaining. I’ll compare these features with JavaScript’s handling of undefined and null values and explore how optionals can enhance code safety and clarity. Keep an eye out!
