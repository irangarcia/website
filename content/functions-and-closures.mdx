As we dive deeper into the shift from JavaScript to Swift, letâ€™s take a look at three key concepts: functions, error handling, and closures. These are important in both languages, but Swift adds its own twists that make your code safer and easier to read.

## Functions: Familiar with Swift Enhancements

Functions in Swift will feel familiar to JavaScript developers, but with some added type safety and syntactic sugar.

**Function Declaration**

In Swift, function declarations are more explicit about parameter types and return values:

```swift
func greet(name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}
```

Compare this to JavaScript:

```jsx
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

Swift's approach eliminates ambiguity about what the function expects and returns.

**Default Parameter Values**

Swift, like JavaScript, supports default parameter values:

```swift
func greet(name: String = "World") -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}

greet() // "Hello, World!"

greet(name: "Swift") // "Hello, Swift!"
```

This is similar to JavaScript's approach:

```jsx
function greet(name = "World") {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

greet(); // "Hello, World!"

greet("JavaScript"); // "Hello, JavaScript!"
```

**Omitting Arguments**

You can also omit argument using an underscore:

```swift
func greet(_ name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}

greet("Swift") // "Hello, Swift!"
```

**Argument Labels**

Swift introduces the concept of argument labels, which can make function calls more readable:

```swift
func greet(to name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}

greet(to: "Swift") // "Hello, Swift!"
```

This feature doesn't exist in JavaScript, where function calls always use the parameter names directly.

**Variadic Functions**

Swift, like JavaScript, supports variadic functions:

```swift
func greet(name: String, friends: String...) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name) and \(friends.joined(separator: ", "))!"
}

greet(name: "Swift", friends: "JavaScript", "TypeScript")
// "Hello, Swift and JavaScript, TypeScript!"
```

This is similar to JavaScript's rest parameters:

```jsx
function greet(name, ...friends) {
    return `Hello, ${name} and ${friends.join(", ")}!`;
}

greet("JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Swift");
// "Hello, JavaScript and TypeScript, Swift!"
```

## Error Handling: Safer and More Structured

Swift's error handling is more structured compared to JavaScript's try-catch mechanism, providing better control and clarity.

**Defining Errors**

In Swift, you typically define errors as an enum that conforms to the Error protocol:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case badURL
    case noData
    case decodingError
}
```

JavaScript doesn't have a built-in way to define custom error types, though you can create Error subclasses:

```jsx
class NetworkError extends Error {
    constructor(message) {
        super(message);
        this.name = "NetworkError";
    }
}
```

**Throwing and Catching Errors**

Swift uses the `throws` keyword to indicate a function can throw an error:

```swift
func fetchData(from url: String) throws -> Data {
    guard let url = URL(string: url) else {
        throw NetworkError.badURL
    }
    // Fetch data...
}

do {
    let data = try fetchData(from: "https://api.example.com")
    // Use data...
} catch NetworkError.badURL {
    print("Invalid URL")
} catch {
    print("An error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

This is more explicit than JavaScript's approach:

```jsx
async function fetchData(url) {
    if (!url.startsWith('http')) {
        throw new NetworkError("Invalid URL");
    }
    // Fetch data...
}

try {
    const data = await fetchData("https://api.example.com");
    // Use data...
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
        console.log("Network error:", error.message);
    } else {
        console.log("An error occurred:", error);
    }
}
```

## Closures: Powerful and Concise

Closures in Swift are similar to JavaScript's arrow functions but with some additional features.

**Basic Syntax**

Swift's closure syntax might look a bit different at first:

```swift
let multiply = { (a: Int, b: Int) -> Int in
    return a * b
}
```

This is equivalent to JavaScript's arrow function:

```jsx
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
```

**Shorthand Argument Names**

Swift provides shorthand argument names for closures, making them even more concise:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let squared = numbers.map { $0 * $0 }
```

While JavaScript doesn't have this feature, you can achieve similar conciseness with arrow functions:

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squared = numbers.map(n => n * n);
```

**Trailing Closures**

Swift has a special syntax for functions that take a closure as their last argument:

```swift
func performOperation(_ operation: (Int, Int) -> Int, on a: Int, and b: Int) -> Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

let result = performOperation(on: 5, and: 3) { $0 + $1 }
```

While JavaScript doesn't have an exact equivalent, you can achieve similar readability with higher-order functions:

```jsx
function performOperation(operation, a, b) {
    return operation(a, b);
}

const result = performOperation((a, b) => a + b, 5, 3);
```
